# Task 8: Working with VPNs

## Objective
To understand how VPNs help protect privacy and secure communication.

## Steps Performed

### 1. Setup
- Chosen VPN: **Windscribe (Free Plan)**
- Device/OS: [Your OS, e.g., Windows 10, Android, etc.]
- Signed up and verified account.

### 2. IP Address Verification
- **Without VPN:** 152.59.89.152
- **With VPN:** 87.249.132.202 (Server Location: [e.g., Germany – Frankfurt])
- Verified change using [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com).
- 
### 3. Browsing Test
- Websites loaded successfully.
- Browsing speed was **slower** compared to without VPN (expected due to encryption & tunneling).

### 4. Speed Test
- **Without VPN:** Download = 18.58 Mbps, Upload = 24.12 Mbps, Ping = 58 ms
- **With VPN:** Download = 8.58 Mbps, Upload = 12.28 Mbps, Ping = 42 ms

### 5. Observations
- VPN successfully hides real IP and provides a virtual IP.
- VPN ensures encrypted traffic → better privacy and protection on public Wi-Fi.
- However, VPN reduces speed and may cause latency.

## Key Concepts

- **VPN (Virtual Private Network):** Creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet.
- **Encryption:** Protects data from being intercepted by hackers/ISPs.
- **Privacy:** Hides your real IP and location.
- **Tunneling Protocols:** Common ones include OpenVPN, IKEv2, WireGuard.
- **Limitations:** Reduced speed, some sites block VPNs, free plans have server/data restrictions.

## Conclusion
Using Windscribe VPN, my IP address and location were masked successfully. Browsing was private and secure, but with noticeable reduction in speed. VPNs are useful for privacy, but they are **not a complete anonymity solution**.
